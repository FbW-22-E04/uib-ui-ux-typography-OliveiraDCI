              Often referred to as "The Typographer's Bible," Chapter 6 of
              <strong> <i>The Elements of Typographic Style</i> </strong> covers
              Choosing and Combining Type. Bringhurst reminds us to "Choose
              faces that will survive, and if possible prosper, in the final
              screen conditions" and to "choose faces that suit the task as well
              as the subject." He tells us to "start with a single typographic
              family," but when the time comes to combine fonts, "balance the
              type optically more than mathematically."

              <strong><i>Nice Web Type</i></strong> strikes a balance between
              typographic artistry and technical know-how. In the "fonts"
              section of the site Brown writes, "You may have noticed, there are
              lots of typefaces out there to choose among. Here you'll find the
              ones I prefer, and my reasons."

              While not a typographer himself, Bringhurst is a poet, with a love
              for ideas and a love for the letters and words used to make ideas
              visible.
              <strong><i>The Elements of Typographic Style</i></strong> teaches
              the basics of honoring and respecting the written word -- through
              choosing and combining typefaces; striving for rhythm, proportion,
              and harmony; and designing typographic pages.

              From the website: <strong><i>I love Typography</i></strong> (ILT)
              was born on August 7, 2007. It exists because I have a passion for
              typography, type design, and lettering, and for the words born of
              those disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us
              to draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the
              a’s had an extra bit at the top. This site aims to make the
              subject more accessible, to bring the study of typography to the
              masses, if you will. It's just about impossible to imagine a world
              without type, but at the same time type's ubiquity has most of us
              taking it for granted. So take a closer look." ilovetypography.com

              Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work
              often including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a
              lithographer. In
              <strong><i>Love and Joy About Letters</i></strong> he writes: "I
              discovered the Roman alphabet in all its elegance and its austere
              dignity, and I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters
              are quantities, and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and
              the hand can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of
              the poet sounds and syllables and pauses are quantities, so in
              both cases are the balancing and forward movement of these
              quantities only a matter of skill and feeling and art."
